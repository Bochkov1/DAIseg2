# DAIseg
DAIseg method is created to detect ancient introgressed segments using unadmixed outgroup population and several reference archaic genomes. 

__Input__: .vcf.gz{.tbi} file where merging all Neanderthal, Outgroupand  ingroup observable samples together and three .txt files with ids of each group.

__Output__: .txt file where each line corresponds to the array of tracts with modern and archaic ancestries.


# Pipeline briefly
0. (optionally) Run __panel.preparation.Linux.sh obs.samples.txt outgroup.txt__(or __panel.preparation.MacOS.sh__) with samples' name files to merge 1000GP, neanderthal samples and obtain .vcf.gz file.
1. Using .vcf.gz{.tbi} and files with samples's names to run __./make.obs.sh outgroup.txt archaic.txt obs.samples.txt__ to make observation files.
3. Run __dai.seg.py__ to obtain archaic tracts of samples from  __observations.txt__  with the posssibility of using EM algorithm.



# Files's summary
*  __outgroup.txt__(Africa), __archaic.txt__(Neanderthals)  and __obs.samples.txt__(European), are .txt files which consist of the samples' ids of reference Africans, Neanderthals and observable Europeans written in a column

```


*  __par.file.txt__
```note
29 # years per generation
1.25e-08    #mutation rate Î¼
1e-08    #recombination rate
1000    #window size
start end    #position of the first SNP in .vcf file
t_arch^c    #Coalescent time of AMH and Neanderthals
t_split^c    #Coalescent time out of Africa 
t_intr^c    #coalescent time of archaic segments in modern genome with neanderthal samples
t_intr #introgression time 
0.025    #admixture proportion of archaic introgression
```

By default, the  time values are  550.000, 70.000, 55.000, 55.000 are used to make  initiall guess for the EM algorithm on Step 2. These values are good to find archqic segments but using EM algorithm allows to find short segments.


*  __all.chr22.vcf.gz{.tbi}__ files containing all reference genomes (Outgroup and Archaic) and observable samples with snps only (excluding indels, deletions etc.). The main reason of it is to avoid inconsistencies.
  
* __output.txt__ is a  file 
```note
[[[t_1,t_2], [t_3,t_4], [t_5,t_6]], [[t_2+1, t_3-1], [t_4+1, t_5-1]]]
[[[t'_1,t'_2], [t'_3,t'_4], [t'_5,t'_6]], [[t'_2+1, t'_3-1], [t'_4+1, t'_5-1]]]
...

```
where each two lines correspond to the one diploid sample from obs.samples.txt.





## Step 0. Merging 1000GP  and Archaic genomes
Download 1000GP panel 
>http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/ALL.chr22.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5b.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz 

and  archaic samples 
>http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Vindija/VCF/
>http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/ChagyrskayaOkladnikov/ (split by chromosomes!)

Make .txt files with samples' names  __outgroup.txt__, __obs.samples.txt__, __archaic.txt__

Add full path to files  of 1000GP and three neanderthals to variables __$NAME1000__ and __$n1, $n2, $n3__ in  __panel.preparation.sh__ , change $CHR variable and run 
> ./panel.preparation.Linux.sh obs.samples.txt outgroup.txt__ (for OS Linux)

or

> ./panel.preparation.MacOS.sh obs.samples.txt outgroup.txt__
 
The resulting vcf.gz file is __all.chr22.vcf.gz{.tbi}__

## Step 1.  Make observations

You need  __all.chr22.vcf.gz{.tbi}__,  __outgroup.txt__, __observations.txt__, __archaic.txt__ to run  

>./make.obs.sh outgroup.txt archaic.txt obs.samples.txt

and to make observation files __obs.neand.txt__, __obs.outgroup.txt__ and the file with default parameters and start-end positions __par.file.txt__ (see the File's summary paragraph). 





## Step 2.1 Run DAI.seg without EM algorithm
>  python3 dai.seg.py  --EM no --HMM_par par.file.txt  --o output.tracts.txt

where file par.file.txt was created on the previous Step. 

## Step 2.1 Run DAI.seg using EM algorithm

par.file.txt obtained on the Step 1 could be used as the initial guess for EM algorithm.

There are two possible options to estimate parameters: 
use __--EM_est coal__
> python3 dai.seg.py --EM yes --EM_est coal --HMM_par par.file.txt --o output.tracts.txt

to obtain estimations only for coalescent times 

or use   __--EM_est all__ observable samples
 
> python3 dai.seg.py --EM yes --EM_est all --HMM_par par.file.txt --o output.tracts.txt

to make estimations of coalescent times, split times and admixture proportion.
