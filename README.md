# DAIseg
DAIseg method is created to detect ancient introssed segments using unadmixed outgroup population and several reference archaic genomes(instead of Skov et al'18).

## Data preparation

## Estimation of parameters
There are three main parameters in DAIseg model:
1. mean coalescent time between Neanderthals and AMH t_n,
2. mean coalescent time between Outgroup and Ingroup t_ooa,
3. introgression time of archaic segments into Ingroup.

For example, Outgroup = some African population, Ingroup = Modern Europeans.
